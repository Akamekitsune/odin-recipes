    <p>Russian syrniki or cheese pancakes. These pancakes are beloved all over Eastern Europe. They are usually eaten for breakfast but nothing says you can't enjoy them as a snack either. They are traditionally made with tvorog, a type of fresh farmers cheese found in Russia and other Eastern European countries. You can try to make it with cottage cheese but the taste and texture won't be like the original. But it will still be delicious! Russians traditionally eat these with jam and sour cream, but tyou can top them with honey, syrup or maybe even sweetened condensed milk.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tvorog or farmers cheese, 200 grams</li>
            <li>Eggs, 2</li>
            <li>Flour, 1-2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Sugar, 1-2 tsp</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, 1-2 tsp</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add tvorog, eggs, and sugar to a bowl and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>And the flour and whisk. You can use an electric whisk if you prefer. But a fork works just as well.</li>
            <li>Keep whisking until the mixture looks sticky enough to form balls.</li>
            <li>Flour a surface. Form the syrniki mixure into little pancake shapes and place them on your floured surface. Make sure both sides of syrnikiare dusted with flour so they don't stick.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil over high heat. Once pan is pretty hot, lower the heat to medium before adding syrniki.</li>
            <li>Add syrniki to pan, maybe 3-4 at a time depending on the size of your pan and syrniki.</li>
            <li>Cook syrniki on both sides for three minutes each side. They should be golden brown on both sides.</li>
            <li>Once the syrniki are cooked, you are ready to enjoy!</li>
