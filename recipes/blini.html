    <p>Russian blini are thin pancakes, similar to the French crepe. Traditionally, blini are filled with savory fillings. But they can also be filled and served with sweet and fruit fillings.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk 2 cups/400 ml</li>
        <li>Eggs 2</li>
        <li>Regular Wheat Flour about 150g</li>
        <li>Olive or Sunflower seed oil 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Salt, less than 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack eggs in a bowl and whisk with sugar and salt.</li>
        <li>While still whisking the eggs, mix in about half of the milk.</li>
        <li>Slowly sift in the flour, whisking still to combine with the egg and milk mixture. Sifting will ensure that the batter doesn't have any lumps. Whisk until smooth before adding the rest of the milk.</li>
        <li>Lastly, stir in the oil.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium sized skillet over high heat until it's very hot.</li>
        <li>Before adding any batter, pour a little oil into the pan and use a paper towel to cover the bottom of the pan with the oil.</li>
        <li>Pour a little bit of the batter, about 1/4 cups, into the center of the pan. Swirl the pan quickly to cover the bottom with the batter completely.</li>
        <li>When the blini can be easily picked up by a spatula, flip it over to cook the other side.</li>
        <li>When the blini is a light golden color on both sides, it is ready to be transferred to a plate. Repeat with the rest of the batter.</li>
        <li>Once all the batter has been cooked, you can top and fill your blini with whatever you choose. Cream cheese and some salmon if you want something savory. Or some jam and sour cream if you want something sweet. Enjoy!!</li>
