    <p>Kartoshka, or Soviet Potato Cakes, are a dessert created during the Soviet era as a way to use up old pastries at bakeries. Today, kartoshka are made with store bought cookies and are extremely easy to make at home.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter 100 grams</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk 200 grams</li>
        <li>Cookies, any kind, 300 grams</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder, 1 tbsp</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Soften butter until it's very soft but not melted</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk to the butter and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Crush the cookies into crumbs (can use a food processor). Add cookie crumbs to butter and condensed mixture and mix.</li>
        <li>Shape in balls. You can also shape them to look like little potatoes to fit the name.</li>
        <li>Once all your balls/potatoes are shaped, roll them in the cocoa powder to cover them and to make them look even more potato like.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least an hour or two and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
